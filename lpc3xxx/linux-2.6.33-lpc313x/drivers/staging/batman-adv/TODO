=> proc interface
* implement new interface to add/delete interfaces and setting options
* /proc/sys/net/batman-adv/ as main folder
* in interfaces/ list every available interface of the host
* each interfaces/$iface/ contains the following files:
-> enable (def: 0) [add/remove this interface to batman-adv]
-> ogm_interval (def: 1000) [ogm interval of that interface]
-> context (def: bat0) [later we want to support multiple mesh instances via
-> bat0/bat1/bat2/..]
-> status (read-only) [outputs the interface status from batman's
-> perspective]
* in mesh/batX/ list every available mesh subnet
-> vis_server (def: 0) [enable/disable vis server for that mesh]
-> vis_data (read-only) [outputs the vis data in a raw format]
-> aggregate_ogm (def: 1) [enable/disable ogm aggregation for that mesh]
-> originators (read-only) [outputs the originator table]
-> transtable_global (read-only) [outputs the global translation table]
-> transtable_local (read-only) [outputs the local translation table]

=> vis "raw" data output
* the raw format shall replace dot draw / json to offer a neutral that can
* be converted
* the format (comma seperated entries):
-> "mac" -> mac address of an originator (each line begins with it)
-> "TQ mac value" -> src mac's link quality towards mac address
-> "HNA mac" -> HNA announced by source mac
-> "PRIMARY" -> this is a primary interface
-> "SEC mac" -> secondary mac address of source (requires preceeding
-> PRIMARY)

=> logging
* the log level LOG_TYPE_CRIT, LOG_TYPE_WARN & LOG_TYPE_NOTICE will be
* unified to use printk
* LOG_TYPE_BATMAN & LOG_TYPE_ROUTES will also use printk but only after the
* internal debug level has been raised
* the internal debug level can be modified using a module parameter (debug)
* or at run time via /sys/module/batman-adv/parameters/debug
* make use of printk %pM support instead of converting mac addresses
* manually

=> strip out all backward compatibility support to older kernels
   (only found in compat.h)

=> fix checkpatch.pl errors
