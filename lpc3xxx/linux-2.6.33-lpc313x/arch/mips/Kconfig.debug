config TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT

	default y

source "lib/Kconfig.debug"

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk" if EMBEDDED
	depends on SYS_HAS_EARLY_PRINTK
	default y
	help
	  This option enables special console drivers which allow the kernel
	  to print messages very early in the bootup process.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation,
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly on some machines and
	  doesn't cooperate with an X server. You should normally say N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Built-in kernel command line"
	default n
	help
	  For most systems, it is firmware or second stage bootloader that
	  by default specifies the kernel command line options.  However,
	  it might be necessary or advantageous to either override the
	  default kernel command line or add a few extra options to it.
	  For such cases, this option allows you to hardcode your own
	  command line options directly into the kernel.  For that, you
	  should choose 'Y' here, and fill in the extra boot arguments
	  in CONFIG_CMDLINE.

	  The built-in options will be concatenated to the default command
	  line if CMDLINE_OVERRIDE is set to 'N'. Otherwise, the default
	  command line will be ignored and replaced by the built-in string.

	  Most MIPS systems will normally expect 'N' here and rely upon
	  the command line from the firmware or the second-stage bootloader.

config CMDLINE
	string "Default kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default ""
	help
	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel.  For these platforms, and for the cases
	  when you want to add some extra options to the command line or ignore
	  the default command line, you can supply some command-line options at
	  build time by entering them here.  In other cases you can specify
	  kernel args so that you don't have to set them up in board prom
	  initialization routines.

	  For more information, see the CMDLINE_BOOL and CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	  options.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides firware arguments"
	default n
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	help
	  By setting this option to 'Y' you will have your kernel ignore
	  command line arguments from firmware or second stage bootloader.
	  Instead, the built-in command line will be used exclusively.

	  Normally, you will choose 'N' here.

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Enable stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config SMTC_IDLE_HOOK_DEBUG
	bool "Enable additional debug checks before going into CPU idle loop"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && MIPS_MT_SMTC
	help
	  This option enables Enable additional debug checks before going into
	  CPU idle loop.  For details on these checks, see
	  arch/mips/kernel/smtc.c.  This debugging option result in significant
	  overhead so should be disabled in production kernels.

config SB1XXX_CORELIS
	bool "Corelis Debugger"
	depends on SIBYTE_SB1xxx_SOC
	select DEBUG_INFO
	help
	  Select compile flags that produce code that can be processed by the
	  Corelis mksym utility and UDB Emulator.

config RUNTIME_DEBUG
	bool "Enable run-time debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, some debugging macros will do run-time checking.
	  If you say N here, those macros will mostly turn to no-ops.  See
	  arch/mips/include/asm/debug.h for debugging macros.
	  If unsure, say N.
